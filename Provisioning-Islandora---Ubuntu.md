### Introduction
Within this repository, there will be a stand alone bash script designed to install an all-in-one Islandora stack upon any type of platform e.g Virtual Machine, bare metal server etc. 

This document is for the evaluation and testing of Islandora but with the secondary purpose of explaining all involved installation steps for wider Islandora adoption and educational transparency.
 
###Document Maintainer
This document is being submitted to the Islandora DevOps Interest Group to demonstrate a base Islandora install as performed and agreed upon by the Islandora Community. Any feedback should be directed at the Islandora DevOps Interest Group at https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-DevOps-Interest-Group.

###Server
This document is outlining a single (all-in-one) Islandora stack installation using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system. 

For general purpose repository sites, we recommend at minimum 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB-10GB of RAM. 

This would be scaled up according to user-load, the type of derivative files being generated by the system (ie. creating web friendly version of archival quality images or video are quite processor intensive) and many other factors.  

###SSH keys
User accounts e.g. islandora  
Sudoers config (location, ideal setup)  
iptables (turn off for initial deploy?)  
Install Dependencies and Pre-setup   

###Environment
_created a islandora-install.properties file that should be removed or secured later_

cat ~/islandora-install.properties
