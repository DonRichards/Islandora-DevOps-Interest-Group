* [Islandora Drag n Drop](https://github.com/unc-charlotte-libraries/islandora_ingest_dragndrop) from UNC Charlotte
  * "Designed for ease of use by Archivists, who are in authoritative control; a methodology for creating a drag-and-drop batch ingest workflow powered by a local Linux-based NAS system integrated with an Islandora ingest server."
* [Move to Islandora Kit (MIK)](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) from Simon Fraser University
  * MIK "converts source content files and accompanying metadata into ingest packages used by existing Islandora batch ingest modules, Islandora Batch, Islandora Newspaper Batch, and Islandora Book Batch. In other words, it doesnâ€™t import objects into Islandora, it prepares content for importing into Islandora."
